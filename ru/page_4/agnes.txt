Agnes
Agnes comes from a good home, at least that’s how she sees things. Agnes’ parents have always supported her. Always. It’s just that... well, there’s just really nothing to revolt to. Her older siblings, a couple of years older than her, are all just as successful as her parents and walking in their footsteps. But she’s always been a bit of an afterthought for her parents. She would like to do something different. It’s just so hard to break family patterns. Especially when they are not so pronounced.
Open-minded and single. Likes to read books but considers herself social enough. Has no problem with being classified as a geek girl. Would like to study “something” at the university, preferably a modern language – maybe study abroad? Comfortable with being single, has high standards on a partner due to a somewhat romantic view of life. Not impossible standards though, she is curious after all.

Agnes’ Relations
Olivia: I really like Olivia. She’s a bit introverted but I hope she will open up soon.
Thomas: His standards are too high, but that is far better than too low.
Marcus: I feel that he is the glue holding this group together.
