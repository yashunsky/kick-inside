Marcus
It was Marcus’ idea to go camping. Without him, what would this gang be? He often feels himself as the engine in the group – a feeling that makes him proud but at the same time annoys him. Why aren’t the others coming with initiatives? Are they taking him for granted? Don’t they care? What would happen if he stopped, would the group crumble? For Marcus, the gang is important. He has an easy time making friends but these friends are important to him. He likes to be part of this group and he’d like the others to feel the same. This thing they share, it’s special.
Marcus wants life to always be like this – amongst friends, being free. It makes him feel safe, secure. He dreams about finding the right girl and he secretly has crushes on both Agnes and Olivia. But he’s casual about it. Marcus lives a happy-go-lucky life. Sometimes he feels guilty when he compares his, rather easy, life with the others’, and he wonders if it is his lack of darkness that makes it hard for him to connect with them.

Marcus’ Relations
Olivia: If she understands that Thomas and me both love her, she is hiding it really well.
Agnes: She’s so cool. I wish I were as cool as her.
Thomas: He’s my bro. He’s my moral beacon.
