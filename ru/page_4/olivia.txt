Olivia
She can stare at a flower or a bird on hours at end. She never gets tired of the little things in life and sees a miracle in the smallest insect or snowflake. Do the others find her boring? Is she too old for her age? Sometimes she feels that the others doesn’t see her as a friend, but rather accepts her and lets her come along. She makes friends with boys easier than girls for some reason. It has always been that way. Perhaps she is one of the boys to them?
She wants to feel loved, but love doesn’t seem to be coming her way. Thomas is so sweet, but it’s clear he has no interest in her, other than as a buddy. And she is OK with that, she’d rather have friends than not have them, and being alone in life has its advantages. Though she hates herself for being so scared of everything and everyone and would really like to change.

Olivia’s Relations
Agnes: I envy her, but still I’m glad I’m not like her. Weird.
Thomas: I think I love him. But I don’t think he loves me so why bother?
Marcus: He treats me just as he would treat any other buddy. I like that.
